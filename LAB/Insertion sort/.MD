The program has four steps:

Read the size of an integer array, followed by the elements of the array (no duplicates).
Output the array.
Perform an insertion sort on the array.
Output the number of comparisons and swaps performed.
main() performs steps 1 and 2.

Implement step 3 based on the insertion sort algorithm in the book. Modify InsertionSort() to:

Count the number of comparisons performed.
Count the number of swaps performed.
Output the array during each iteration of the outside loop.
Complete main() to perform step 4, according to the format shown in the example below.

Hints: In order to count comparisons and swaps, modify the while loop in InsertionSort(). Use global variables for comparisons and swaps.

The program provides three helper functions:
